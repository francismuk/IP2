    <h1>Triangle Tracker</h1>
    <p>There are various types of triangles and this is determined by the dimensions of the sides.This Triangle tracker is helpful in knowing the type of any subject triangle. The various types of triangles are mentioned below: </p>

In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</em></p>

In the figure above, the two equal sides have length and the remaining side has length . This property is equivalent to two angles of the triangle being equal. An isosceles triangle therefore has both two equal sides and two equal angles.</em></p>
